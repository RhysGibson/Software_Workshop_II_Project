# Software_Workshop_II_Project

This project is used as a prototype for the Healthcare system described in the Software Engineering Workshop II Course.

We will be implementing requirements gathered, and making them work in the ruby language using ruby on rails.

Currently only two users have been implemented;
test@example.com        testing
a1725098@example.com    testing

On the clinics page, if the map doesn't load first time reload the page manually and it should then show up
